<h1>How the Internet Works</h1>
<hr></hr>
<h2><u>DNS:</u></h2>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internets address book. It changes easy-to-remember website names, like google.com, into special number addresses called IP addresses that computers use to find each other. This way, instead of remembering long numbers, we can just type a simple name to visit a website. Without DNS, using the internet would be much harder.It helps us reach websites easily. When we type a website name, like youtube.com, DNS finds the right number address (IP address) of that site so our computer can connect to it. It works in the background and makes browsing the internet fast and simple.It is a system that connects website names to their real addresses on the internet. Instead of remembering numbers, we just type the website name, and DNS points us to the right place. Itâ€™s what makes surfing the internet easy and user-friendly.</p>

<h2><u>ISP:</u></h2>
<p>An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company that gives people access to the internet. When you want to go online, your computer or phone connects through the ISP, which provides the connection using cables, mobile networks, or Wi-Fi. Examples of ISPs are companies like Airtel, Jio, or AT&T. Without an ISP, we wouldnt be able to use the internet at home or on our devices.It is a company that lets you connect to the internet. When you pay for internet service at home or on your phone, the ISP is the one giving you that connection. They provide the network so you can browse websites, watch videos, and use apps online.ISPs can offer internet through different ways like cables, fiber, or mobile data. Some popular ISPs are Jio, Airtel, BSNL, and Vodafone. Without an ISP, we would not be able to access the internet from our homes, offices, or mobile devices.</p>

<h2><u>Client:</u></h2>
<p>A Client in the internet is a computer, phone, or device that asks for information or services from another computer. For example, when you use a web browser like Chrome or Safari to open a website, your device is acting as the client.The client sends a request to a server, which is a computer that stores the website or service. The server then replies by sending back the information, such as a webpage, video, or file. This process happens very quickly, so it feels instant to us.In simple words, the client is the users side of the internet. It is what we use to request data, while the server provides that data. Without clients, we would not be able to interact with websites, apps, or online services.</p>

<h2><u>Server:</u></h2>
<p>A server on the internet is a special type of computer that stores and provides information, services, or files to other computers. When you visit a website, watch a video, or send an email, you are actually requesting data from a server. It works like a library or a restaurant: you ask for something, and the server delivers it to you.Servers are always connected to the internet and designed to handle many requests at the same time. For example, when millions of people use Google at once, Googles servers respond by sending search results to everyone almost instantly. These machines are usually more powerful than regular home computers because they need to work continuously without interruption.There are different types of servers depending on their job: web servers deliver websites, mail servers handle emails, and file servers store and share files.</p>
