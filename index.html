    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Karan Sukumar, and I am a passionate and motivated Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) graduate
        with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning. Throughout my academic and
        personal journey, I have developed a deep curiosity for understanding how digital systems work, how software can
        solve real-world problems, and how innovation in computing can transform lives and industries.</p>
    <p>From the very beginning of my studies, I immersed myself in subjects like programming, database management,
        computer networks, and software engineering. This academic foundation allowed me to gain strong technical
        knowledge, while also nurturing logical thinking and analytical skills. I learned to approach challenges with a
        structured mindset, break down complex problems into smaller solvable parts, and implement solutions that are
        both efficient and reliable. My education in BCA has not only equipped me with core technical expertise but also
        instilled in me an appreciation for teamwork, adaptability, and lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have developed proficiency in languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python, along with experience
        in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I also explored database systems such as MySQL and
        Oracle, which gave me the confidence to design and manage data-driven applications. While these technical skills
        form the backbone of my professional profile, I equally value soft skills such as communication, leadership, and
        collaboration, which I believe are crucial in todays dynamic work environments.</p>
    <p>My academic projects allowed me to put theory into practice. From creating small applications to designing
        structured solutions for specific problems, I have enjoyed the process of ideation, development, testing, and
        improvement. These projects not only tested my technical abilities but also taught me valuable lessons in
        project management, teamwork, and time management.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I am a person who believes in continuous self-improvement. I regularly update myself with the
        latest trends in technology—whether it is artificial intelligence, cloud computing, or cybersecurity—because I
        believe the IT industry evolves rapidly, and staying ahead requires curiosity and adaptability. I also enjoy
        solving logical puzzles, working on personal coding projects, and experimenting with new tools, all of which
        sharpen my creativity and technical agility.</p>
